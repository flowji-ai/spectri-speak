# Migrating a Plan

For capturing an existing plan from an agent's built-in planning and translating it to directional form. If authoring a new plan from scratch, see `creating-a-plan.md` instead.

## Guiding Principles

### Agent plans are always prescriptive

Plans from Claude's `~/.claude/plans/` and OpenCode's `.opencode/plans/` are written by the planning agent for its own use — they contain code blocks, specific variable names, line references, and enumerated implementation steps. This is fine for the agent that wrote them, but unusable as coordination documents. Translation to directional form is mandatory.

### Translation is not editing — it's rewriting

Don't try to "clean up" the source plan. Read it, understand the intent, and rewrite it from scratch in directional form. The source is a reference, not a starting point for editing.

### Preserve the source

The original plan file stays where it is. The create script records its path in frontmatter (`original:` field) for traceability.

## Known Plan Sources

| Agent | Location | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/plans/` | Markdown, global (not per-project) |
| **OpenCode** | `.opencode/plans/` | Markdown, per-project |

Other agents may persist plans in the future — the workflow is the same regardless of source.

## Steps

<IMPORTANT>
**Before starting work on the steps below:**

1. Read the detailed instructions for each step in the sections that follow
2. Create a TodoWrite item for every step in this list

**MUST NOT modify this file to check off steps.**

- [ ] 1. Locate the source plan
- [ ] 2. Read and understand intent
- [ ] 3. Rewrite in directional form
- [ ] 4. Review for directional quality
- [ ] 5. Run create script
- [ ] 6. Commit the plan

### Step 1: Locate the source plan

Find the plan file in the agent's plan directory:

- **Claude** — `~/.claude/plans/`. Plans are named by session. Identify which session plan is relevant.
- **OpenCode** — `.opencode/plans/` in the project directory.

Read the file. If multiple plans exist and it's unclear which one applies, ask the user.

### Step 2: Read and understand intent

Read the entire source plan. Identify:

- The overall goal — what is this plan trying to achieve?
- The logical steps — what needs to happen in what order?
- Dependencies between steps
- Which steps involve code changes vs artefact creation vs other work
- Which existing Spectri skills or commands each step should use

Do not start rewriting until you understand the full plan.

### Step 3: Rewrite in directional form

Write the plan from scratch in directional form. For each step:

- **What** needs to happen (outcome, not implementation)
- **Why** it matters (context for the implementing agent)
- **What success looks like**
- **Which skill or command** to use — name it, don't enumerate its steps

Strip everything prescriptive from the source:

| Source contains | Translation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Code blocks | Remove entirely — describe the expected outcome instead |
| Line number references | Remove — describe the file and what should change |
| Enumerated skill steps | Replace with "use [skill-name]" |
| Specific variable/function names | Keep only when essential for clarity; describe intent instead |

Include an empty `## Execution Log` section at the end of the rewritten plan.

### Step 4: Review for directional quality

Verify the rewritten plan meets directional standards:

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| No code blocks | |
| No line number references | |
| No enumerated skill/command steps (point to the skill, don't list its steps) | |
| Each step describes an outcome, not an implementation | |
| An agent with zero codebase context could understand what to do | |
| Includes `## Execution Log` section (empty) | |

See `plan-conventions.md` for the full directional standard and the graduated scale for when prescriptive elements are justified.

### Step 5: Run create script

```bash
bash .spectri/scripts/spectri-trail/create-llm-plan.sh \
  --title "Plan Title" \
  --slug "plan-slug" \
  --original "<path-to-source-plan>" \
  --agent <agent-name>
```

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `--title` | Yes | Human-readable plan title |
| `--slug` | Yes | Kebab-case identifier for the filename |
| `--original` | Yes | Path to the source plan file |
| `--agent` | Yes | Agent that authored the original (claude, opencode, etc.) |
| `--source` | No | Path to the originating prompt, if one exists |
| `--workstream` | No | Workstream tag |
| `--reviewed-by` | No | Who reviewed the plan |
| `--json` | No | Output created path as JSON |

The script creates proper frontmatter (including `original:` pointing to the source), copies the rewritten plan body, and auto-stages the file.

### Step 6: Commit the plan

Commit the staged plan file:

```
docs(plan): migrate <plan-slug> from <source-agent> — <brief description>
```

**Terminal state:** Plan committed with directional content, source path recorded in frontmatter.
