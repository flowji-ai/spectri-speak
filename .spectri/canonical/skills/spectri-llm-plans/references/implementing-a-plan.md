# Implementing a Plan

## Guiding Principles

### Smallest piece of work

Commit and test early, commit and test often. Don't accumulate dozens of file changes — break work into commits at natural chunk boundaries. A completed plan should be a trail of small commits, not one massive changeset.

### Delegated skill owns all obligations

When a plan step points to a skill or command (e.g. "resolve issue X using spectri-resolve-issue"), the agent runs that skill and the skill owns all obligations for that step. The plan does not independently layer spectri-code-change on top. Follow the delegated skill fully, then return to the plan and check off the item.

### Scope containment

If you discover unrelated problems while implementing, capture them as separate issues with `/spec.issue`. Do not expand plan scope mid-execution.

### Plans coordinate, skills drive

The plan says what needs to happen. Skills say how. If a plan step and a skill disagree, the skill is authoritative — the plan may be stale or imprecise. When in doubt, follow the skill.

## Steps

<IMPORTANT>
**Before starting work on the steps below:**

1. Read the detailed instructions for each step in the sections that follow
2. Read and understand the workflow diagram at the end of the step details
3. Create a TodoWrite item for every step in this list

**MUST NOT modify this file to check off steps.**
</IMPORTANT>

- [ ] 1. Check for continuation context
- [ ] 2. Read the full plan
- [ ] 3. Create TodoWrite items for each plan step
- [ ] 4. Execute each step (decision tree)
- [ ] 5. Record execution notes after each step
- [ ] 6. Commit at natural chunk boundaries
- [ ] 7. Plan completion review
- [ ] 8. When all steps done — route to resolving

### Step 1: Check for continuation context

Check `spectri/coordination/threads/` for threads referencing this plan. A previous agent may have started implementation and left handoff notes.

### Step 2: Read the full plan

Read the entire plan file. Understand the full scope before executing any steps.

If the plan references skills, commands, or other artefacts, read those too — you need to understand what each step involves before creating your work plan.

<HARD-GATE>
Do not start executing until you understand the full plan scope and have identified which skill or workflow each step requires. If anything is ambiguous, ask the user for clarification.
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 3: Create TodoWrite items for each plan step

Create a TodoWrite item for every step in the plan. This is your tracking mechanism for progress.

### Step 4: Execute each step (decision tree)

For each plan step, determine which path applies:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Plan step"] --> Q{"Does this step\npoint to a skill\nor command?"}
    Q -- "Yes" --> D["Follow that skill/command fully.\nIt owns all obligations."]
    Q -- "No" --> Q2{"Does this step\ninvolve code,\nconfig, or docs?"}
    Q2 -- "Yes" --> CC["Follow spectri-code-change obligations:\n- Identify governing spec\n- Write test if code\n- Make the change\n- Sub-agent review\n- Update callers if signatures changed\n- Run tests\n- Update spec if behaviour changed\n- Build/sync if needed"]
    Q2 -- "No" --> E["Execute directly\n(e.g. research, create artefact,\nrun a script)"]
    D --> Done["Mark step complete\n→ Step 5"]
    CC --> Done
    E --> Done
```

**Path A — Step delegates to a skill or command:**
Run that skill or command. The skill handles everything: spec lookup, tests, review, commit bundle. When the skill completes, return to the plan.

<CRITICAL>
The skill is authoritative. If the skill encounters a hard-gate that stops execution (e.g. blocked issue, failing precondition), that gate takes precedence over the plan. Do not override the skill's hard-gates to satisfy the plan. Record the gate in your execution notes and ask the user how to proceed.
</CRITICAL>

**Path B — Step involves code/config/docs without a named skill:**
Follow `spectri-code-change` obligations. This means: identify the governing spec (if any), write a test (if code), make the change, review with sub-agents, update callers, run tests, update the spec if behaviour changed, build/sync if deployed files affected.

**Path C — Step is non-code work:**
Execute directly. This covers research tasks, artefact creation, running scripts, or other work that doesn't produce code changes.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll batch the whole plan into one commit at the end" | Commit per natural chunk. A trail of small commits, not one massive changeset. |
| "The plan said to do X so I skipped the skill's steps" | The skill is authoritative, not the plan. Follow the skill fully. |
| "I found a related problem so I fixed it too" | Scope creep. Capture with `/spec.issue` and stay on the plan. |
| "I don't need to check for a governing spec — it's just a plan" | Path B still requires spec lookup. Plans don't exempt you from code-change obligations. |

### Step 5: Record execution notes after each step

After completing each plan step, mark it off in your TodoWrite and append an execution log entry to the plan file.

<HARD-GATE>
Every plan step MUST have a corresponding execution log entry before proceeding to the next step. A step without a log entry is not complete — regardless of whether the code was written and committed.
</HARD-GATE>

Append entries to the `## Execution Log` section at the end of the plan file. Use the format:

```markdown
### [Agent Session ID] — Step [N] — [Date]
- **What was done**: [summary]
- **Verification**: [test results, command output, pass/fail — evidence, not just "done"]
- **Blockers/deviations**: [anything unexpected, or "none"]
- **Commit**: [hash, or "no commit for this step"]
```

Each entry MUST include verification evidence — test output summaries, command results, pass/fail status. "Tests passed" is acceptable; omitting the field entirely is not. A reviewing agent uses these entries to confirm compliance without re-running the work.

Rules:
- Each agent adds new entries; do not edit previous entries
- Record blockers and deviations, not just successes
- If a step has no verification requirement, state "N/A — no verification defined for this step"
- When the plan resolves, the execution log becomes the permanent audit trail

See `plan-conventions.md` for the execution log convention and why it exists.

### Step 6: Commit at natural chunk boundaries

Commit per natural chunk of work — not per plan step, not per skill invocation, not all at end. A natural chunk is the smallest coherent piece of work that makes sense on its own.

What belongs in each intermediate commit:

- The code/config/docs changes for this chunk
- Updated tests for changed code
- Spec update if this chunk changed documented behaviour
- `/spec.summary` if a spec was updated

### Step 7: Plan completion review

When all plan steps are marked complete with execution notes, run the plan completion review before routing to resolving. See `plan-completion-review.md` for the full process.

Launch 3 review sub-agents in parallel (2 Claude + 1 Qwen via PAL MCP server) to assess the cumulative result of all plan steps. This is distinct from per-commit code reviews — it evaluates the plan as a whole.

<HARD-GATE>
Do not route to resolving until all review feedback is addressed. An unreviewed plan completion is an unverified plan completion.
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 8: When all steps done — route to resolving

When every plan step is marked complete and the completion review has passed, proceed to `resolving-a-plan.md` to close out the plan.

If you are approaching context limits before all steps are done, stop and create a thread using the `spectri-threads` skill immediately. Include: which steps are complete (with commit hashes), the next step to execute, and any blockers found. You do not need to complete the entire plan in one session.

<HARD-GATE>
Do not end your session without either resolving the plan or creating a thread (using the `spectri-threads` skill) with handoff notes for the next agent. Unresolved plans without continuation context get lost.
</HARD-GATE>

**Terminal state:** All plan steps executed and marked complete with execution notes. Completion review passed. Plan routed to `resolving-a-plan.md`.
